= Remote Chunking

- Processing is split across multiple processes
- The communication between manager and workers is done through some middleware
- Middleware must be durable
- The manager reads the data and send over the wire to the workers
- Workers process the data and return it to the manager
- IO intensive

Manager

[source, java, linenums]
----
public TaskletStep stepOne() {
  return stepBuilderFactory
    .get("remoteStep")
    .chunk(100)
    .reader(libraryReader(null))    (1) no processor or writer
    .outputChannel(requests())      (2) send data
    .inputChannel(responses())      (3) receive data
    .build();
}
----
Worker

[source, java, linenums]
----
public IntegrationFlow integrationFlow() {
  return this.workerBuilder
  .itemProcessor(rentalProcessor()) (1) processor
  .itemWriter(writer(null))         (2) writer
  .inputChannel(requests())         (3) receive data
  .outputChannel(responses())       (4) send data
  .build();
