= About this repository

This document explains how to run the examples from this repository.
All of them read from a flat file and write to a DB.

## Requirements

- Java 17
- MySQL running on port 3306
- Import the schema.sql file to the running MySQL instance
- Build the project `mvn clean verify`

## Jobs

### SimpleJob

It's a simple job with a flat file reader and a JdbcWriter. It's the base code for all others jobs.

To run:

`java -jar cloud-batch-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=simple`

### MultithreadedJob

Same as the SimpleJob but each chunk will run on a separated thread.

To run:

`java -jar cloud-batch-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=multi`

### AsyncJob

Will run with AsyncProcessor and AsyncWriters.

To run:

`java -jar cloud-batch-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=async`

### Manager and Worker Configuration

To run this example you will also need RabbitMQ running on port 5672, and two durable queues (requests and responses).

Together they are an implementation of Remote Chunking model.
To run:

- start 1+ instances of the Spring Boot app with the profile "worker".

`java -jar cloud-batch-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=worker`

- start 1 instance of the Spring Boot app with the profile "manager".

`java -jar cloud-batch-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=manager`
